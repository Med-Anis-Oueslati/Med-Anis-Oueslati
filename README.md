## 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on, impact-driven engineer blending **Generative AI** with **real-time data engineering** to solve modern security and analytics challenges. From crafting multi-agent systems for automated threat detection to deploying AI-powered quiz generators, I build solutions that think, adapt, and scale.

Currently, I'm developing **Falcon**, a full-stack **SIEM** system with an embedded **LLM-powered conversational agent**, anomaly detection pipeline, and mitigation automation—all.
